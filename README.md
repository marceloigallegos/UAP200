# A set of 200 instances of Unbalanced Assignment Problems

This repository stores a total of 200 instances of unbalanced allocation problems. The ideal objective of these instances is to test methods or algorithms that can solve the UAP.

The instances contemplate different configurations of tasks and agents, and have a range of allocation costs between 100 and 990 monetary units. All the instances were randomly generated, having a total of 5 instances for each configuration.

Instances_GAMS: It contains the 200 instances in an input format for the GAMS Software, considering T-Rows (Tasks) and A-Columns (Agents).

Instances_Agent-Task: It contains the 200 instances in an input format for a Python Implementation, with A-Rows (Agents), and T-Columns (Tasks).
